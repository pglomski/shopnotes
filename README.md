Drill speed chart
=================

Create a custom drill press speed chart for your shop! I have a Rigid DP1500 series press and the 
attached .png contains ticks for the speeds found on my press. If the speeds on your press don't 
match or you'd like to tweak the image for your own purposes, the source code is included. Laminate 
it at Staples for $2 and hang it next to your press for quick speed lookup given any common hole 
size and material.
